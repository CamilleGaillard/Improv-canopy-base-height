sorry, again a modified version:
/mnt/biogeo/shared/aDGVM_simon_150421/

* I made a mistake when I integrated Liams code and did not calculate 
leaf_width_grass in PlantClass.cpp, it was always 0 => lai_=inf => MyMin( 
lai_, 10. )=10 => no allocation to grass leaf biomass
* fire patchiness included in PlantPopClass, this defines how many plants are 
affected by fire
* flame height calculated in PlantPopClass (and not in PlantClass), this saves 
time because it is equal for all plants
* dry fuel moisture (tmp_smo) divided by 100, this should be between 0 and 1
* calculations for dead and live fuel biomass changed 
* wet fuel moisture is now constant (0.85, but we should try and find a value 
in the literature)
* fixed NcInputClass to convert WP, FC, and Wsat from % to fraction!

there will be more changes in the fire model soon:
* fire impact model in PlantClass will change
* we will probably include a fire danger index to represent dry fuel moisture
