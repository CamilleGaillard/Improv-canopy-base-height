// Use this configuration file to store meta-information required for the model runs, e.g., file paths to climate and soil 
// input data files, which variables should be written to the output file, how many years to run...
// this allows to configure the runs in a more flexible way, and avoids having to recompile every time some of the meta-information changes

// Input files:
infile:
{
soilfile = "/home/sscheiter/NcInputFiles/global_range/unified_soildata_1deg.nc";
climfile = "/home/sscheiter/NcInputFiles/global_range/climvars_1deg.nc";
};
// Additional information required for the run

simulation:
{
	YEARS_TO_RUN = 600;
	W_SHRUBS = 1; 
};

grazing:
{	
	WITH_GRAZING = 0 ;		// 0: run without grazing; 1 run with grazing
	COWS_PER_HA = 0.125 ;
	DEMAND_COW = 50.;		// 50 kg of grass biomass per day and cow; make variable later on (fodder quality, cow race, gender, age...);
	MERISTEM = 0.02;		// [kg]; 20 g of each grass individual need to remain on the base, cannot be grazed (mouth shape, too close to ground); 
	FREQUENCY = 1.			// fraction of the year during which grazing will take place
};
